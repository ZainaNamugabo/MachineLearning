Loan Recommendation System using K-Means Clustering
This project implements an unsupervised machine learning approach to build a Loan Recommendation System using K-Means Clustering. The system analyzes customer financial profiles to segment them into distinct groups based on similarities in features such as income, credit debt, employment status, Age, and Default income ration. These clusters are then used to recommend the most suitable loan products for each customer group.

üîç Key Features:
Customer segmentation using K-Means clustering

Feature engineering and dimensionality reduction for better clustering performance

Data preprocessing pipeline: handling missing values, scaling, encoding

Visualizations: cluster distribution, feature importance, and customer group insights

Recommendation logic based on nearest cluster centroid profiles

üì¶ Use Cases:
FinTech platforms targeting personalized lending solutions

Financial institutions for customer profiling and market segmentation

Preprocessing step before supervised loan approval models
